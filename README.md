 Inefficiencies in Traditional Recruitment
Manual resume screening and initial phone interviews are resource-intensive and prone to bias.
Matching resumes to job descriptions often lacks precision, leading to suboptimal candidate selection.
Advancements in Matching Techniques
Leveraging advanced algorithms for resume and job description matching enhances accuracy and efficiency.
Ranking resumes based on similarity and predicting matching percentages streamlines candidate evaluation.
Need for Personalized Screening & Chatbot Automation
Standardized questions may not capture the full scope of a candidate’s fit.
Personalized questions tailored to specific job
Automating initial screenings with a chatbot reduces human error and standardizes and  evaluate candidates’ job fit, domain knowledge, and cultural alignment.
